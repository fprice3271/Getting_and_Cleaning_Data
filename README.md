# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## **Coursera Course: Getting and Cleaning Data**

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.  The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## **About the Script and Tidy Data Set**

The raw data can be accessed at: (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).  
The UCI HAR Dataset was extracted and made available in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset".

A script was created called run_analysis.R to do the following tasks:
  1. merge the test and training sets together to create one data set
  2. extract the measurements on mean and standard deviation for each measurement
  3. appropriately label the data set
  4. create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and subject, written to a txt file called mean_data_tidy.txt

## **More Information**

The CodeBook.md file explains the variables, data and transformations preformed.

More information on the data set can also be found at (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
